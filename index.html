        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary is home to 13 horses, 9 mini horses, 5 small ponies, 3 large ponies, and 6 donkeys.
            Our President and sole staff member, Angela, has voluntarily been taking care of these animals (and many
            more!) for over 20 years. Over this time, she has provided a sanctuary for many neglected animals, aided in
            natural disaster relief/rescue, and educated the community on responsible equine ownership. In 2024,
            <b>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary Foundation</b> was founded on Angela's behalf to support her in caring for
            neglected
            animals and sustain her mission.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Needs</h1>
        <p>100% of all donations to the general fund will be used to take care of our animals and further our mission.
        </p>
        <p>While in the near-term our focus is providing daily care for our animals, we do have future goals we'd love
            to share:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the monthly cost of grain, hay, and medical expenses, ensuring the nutritional needs of the
                equestrian animals are met on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Acquire a stock-type trailer capable of transporting multiple animals simultaneously during emergencies
                such as fires or natural disasters, ensuring the safety and well-being of all equestrian animals under
                the organization's care.</li>
            <li>Purchasing additional land beyond the current location to expand pasture space, providing additional
                grazing areas and shelter for the equestrian animals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>Our vision is centered on the fundamental belief that every equestrian animal deserves to live a life free
            from neglect and suffering. We envision a future where neglected horses, ponies, and other equines are
            provided with comprehensive care programs tailored to their specific needs. Through our efforts, these
            animals will not only be rescued from dire situations but also rehabilitated physically, emotionally, and
            psychologically, enabling them to thrive in loving and supportive environments.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we aspire to cultivate a culture of responsible ownership within the equestrian community and
            beyond. Through educational initiatives, we seek to raise awareness about the proper care and treatment of
            equines, emphasizing the importance of empathy, understanding, and commitment. By empowering individuals
            with knowledge and resources, we aim to prevent neglect and abuse before they occur, ultimately creating
            healthier and happier lives for equestrian animals worldwide.</p>
        <p>In pursuit of our vision, we are dedicated to collaborating with like-minded organizations, advocates, and
            volunteers who share our passion for animal welfare. Together, we will work tirelessly to transform the
            lives of neglected equestrian animals and inspire positive change within society, fostering a future where
            compassion, kindness, and respect extend to all living beings.</p>
