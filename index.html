        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p><b>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary</b> is a haven for 13 horses, 9 mini horses, 5 small ponies, 3 large ponies, and 6
            donkeys. Since 2015, our President, Angela—a full-time public school teacher and the sanctuary's sole 
            staff member—has voluntarily dedicated her time to the daily care and rehabilitation of these animals 
            and many others. Her work has created a refuge for neglected equines, contributed to natural disaster 
            rescue efforts, and helped educate the community on responsible equine ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2024, <b>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary Foundation</b> was established to support Angela's unwavering commitment 
            and ensure the long-term sustainability of her mission. A dedicated board of directors was formed to provide 
            strategic oversight, governance, and stewardship of resources. Together, we remain focused on protecting, 
            rescuing, and advocating for equines in need.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Needs</h1>
        <p>100% of all donations to the general fund will be used to take care of our animals and further our mission.
            This includes covering essential monthly expenses such as grain, hay, and medical care, ensuring our
            equestrian residents receive consistent nutrition, care and attention.
        </p>
        <p>While our immediate priority is meeting the daily needs of our animals, we do have future goals we'd love
            to share:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sanctuary Repairs and Upkeep:</b> Invest in repairing and maintaining our current barn, ensuring it
                remains a safe, functional, and comfortable home for our animals.
            <li><b>Emergency Preparedness:</b> Acquire a stock-type trailer capable of safely transporting multiple
                animals during emergencies
                like wildfires or natural disasters, protecting the well-being of all under our care.</li>
            <li><b>Expanding Our Sanctuary:</b> Purchase additional land to increase pasture space, providing more
                grazing areas and shelter
                for our growing equestrian family.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your generosity helps us care for our animals today and build a brighter future for them tomorrow.</p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>We envision a world where every equine—horse, pony, mini, or donkey—lives free from neglect, cruelty, and 
            suffering. Our goal is to ensure that neglected equines receive the individualized care they need to heal 
            physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Through compassionate rescue and rehabilitation, we help them 
            recover and thrive in safe, nurturing environments.</p>
        <p>Beyond rescue, our vision includes a future where responsible equine ownership is the norm. Through education 
            and outreach, we aim to foster a culture of empathy, accountability, and proper care within the equestrian 
            community and beyond. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and resources to prevent harm, we strive 
            to stop neglect before it begins.</p>
        <p>Realizing this vision requires collective effort. We are committed to working alongside fellow advocates, 
            organizations, and volunteers to champion equine welfare. Together, we will build a more compassionate 
            world—one where all equines are treated with dignity, kindness, and respect.</p>
