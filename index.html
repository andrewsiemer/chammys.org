        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary is a haven for 13 horses, 9 mini horses, 5 small ponies, 3 large ponies, and 6
            donkeys. Since 2015, Angela, our President and sole staff member, has dedicated herself to voluntarily
            caring for these
            animals—and countless others. During this time, she has created a refuge for neglected equines, participated
            in natural
            disaster rescues, and educated the community about responsible equine ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2024, <b>Chammy's Equine Sanctuary Foundation</b> was established to support Angela's efforts and
            sustain her mission of
            rescuing and caring for neglected animals. A dedicated Board of Directors was formed to provide guidance,
            strategic
            oversight, and ensure the foundation's long-term health and integrity. Their leadership ensures that every
            resource is
            managed responsibly, aligning with our mission to protect and advocate for equines in need.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Needs</h1>
        <p>100% of all donations to the general fund will be used to take care of our animals and further our mission.
            This includes covering essential monthly expenses such as grain, hay, and medical care, ensuring our
            equestrian
            residents receive consistent nutrition and attention.
        </p>
        <p>While our immediate priority is meeting the daily needs of our animals, we do have future goals we'd love
            to share:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sanctuary Repairs and Upkeep:</b> Invest in repairing and maintaining our current barn, ensuring it
                remains a safe,
                functional, and comfortable home for our animals.
            <li><b>Emergency Preparedness:</b> Acquire a stock-type trailer capable of safely transporting multiple
                animals during emergencies
                like wildfires or natural disasters, protecting the well-being of all under our care.</li>
            <li><b>Expanding Our Sanctuary:</b> Purchase additional land to increase pasture space, providing more
                grazing areas and shelter
                for our growing equestrian family.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your generosity helps us care for our animals today and build a brighter future for them tomorrow.</p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>Our vision is centered on the fundamental belief that every equestrian animal deserves to live a life free
            from neglect and suffering. We envision a future where neglected horses, ponies, and other equines are
            provided with comprehensive care programs tailored to their specific needs. Through our efforts, these
            animals will not only be rescued from dire situations but also rehabilitated physically, emotionally, and
            psychologically, enabling them to thrive in loving and supportive environments.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we aspire to cultivate a culture of responsible ownership within the equestrian community and
            beyond. Through educational initiatives, we seek to raise awareness about the proper care and treatment of
            equines, emphasizing the importance of empathy, understanding, and commitment. By empowering individuals
            with knowledge and resources, we aim to prevent neglect and abuse before they occur, ultimately creating
            healthier and happier lives for equestrian animals worldwide.</p>
        <p>In pursuit of our vision, we are dedicated to collaborating with like-minded organizations, advocates, and
            volunteers who share our passion for animal welfare. Together, we will work tirelessly to transform the
            lives of neglected equestrian animals and inspire positive change within society, fostering a future where
            compassion, kindness, and respect extend to all living beings.</p>
